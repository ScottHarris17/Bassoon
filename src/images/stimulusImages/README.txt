Load image stimuli into this folder.

Image files should be loaded into subdirectories.

When running stimuli that use images, change the attributes to locate the directory with desired image album based on what you have placed in this folder. Also change the image extension to look for. Generally, the stimuli that use images will draw from all of the images in the folder that you direct Bassoon to. If you just want to use a single image, for example, just place that one image in the folder. Note, that Bassoon can draw images from any directory on your device if you direct it to the proper location (i.e., there is no strict requirement to load images here).

Each directory with images should also have a .JSON file in which data about the images is stored. See the example JSON file for more information.

If no JSON file is supplied, or if necessary values are missing, the protocols will use the default image data for the UPENN Natural Image data base: https://web.sas.upenn.edu/upennidb/albums/
