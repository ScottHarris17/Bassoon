    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p> Bassoon relies on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target = "_blank">Python 3</a> and the <a href='https://www.psychopy.org' target="_blank">Psychopy</a> libraries. Follow these steps to install Bassoon on your local computer:
        <ol>
            <li><u>Download Bassoon:</u> Download a zipped Bassoon folder <a href="https://github.com/ScottHarris17/Bassoon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">here</a>. You can also download or clone directly from the <a href="https://github.com/ScottHarris17/Bassoon" target="_blank">Github repository.</a> Once downloaded, extract the files into a directory on your local computer.</li>
            <li><u>Download Python 3:</u> Download Python onto your computer using the latest version available <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target = "_blank">here.</a> Ensure that you have selected a Python 3 release.</li>
            <li><u>Install a Python IDE:</u> This step is not strictly required, but highly recommended. It will allow you to make changes to your local copy of Bassoon, including adding or modifying stimuli. A popular option is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target = "_blank">VS Code</a> (you can follow <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial" target = "_blank">these instructions</a> on how to connect VS code to python).</li>
            <li><u>Install Psychopy:</u> The best practice is to create a virtual environment through which to install psychopy. You will want to install the virtual environment inside of the Bassoon directory on your computer (i.e., in the outermost directory called "Bassoon" in the files that you downloaded above). You can create a virtual environment directly on VS Code by following <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_create-a-virtual-environment" target="_blank">these instructions.</a> Once you have a virtual environment installed, you can enter <code>pip install psychopy</code> into your terminal to install Pyschopy and its dependencies. If you are trouble shooting, complete installation instructions for Psychopy can be found here, <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/download.html#manual-installations" target = "_blank">here</a> (note, Bassoon uses the psychopy python API, so it is not enough to install the standalone version of Psychopy. Instead, you must use one of the manual installation options).</li>            
        </ol>

        You should now be ready to run Bassoon. Locate the file called <em>main.py</em>, which is located in /Bassoon/src/. Either open this file in your IDE and press run, or run it directly from your terminal (on Windows: <code>python /path/to/main.py</code>). If the Bassoon window launches, then you have success! If you encounter an error (either here or at any further step) make sure you have the neccessary dependencies installed. It is possible that you still need to install the following libraries into your virtual environment:
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li><code>pip install tkinter</code></li>
            <li><code>pip install pyserial</code></li>
            <li><code>pip install json</code></li>
        </ul>
        
        The terminal/command prompt is your friend. Read any error messages for hints about possible errors, dependency problems and more.
    </p>

    <h3>Installing with Anaconda</h3>
    The easiest way to make sure your machine has all the dependencies that are required to run Bassoon is to install
    Psychopy as an Anaconda environment.
    First download and install <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual'>Anaconda</a> if you do not already
    have it. Make sure your installation is set to include python 3+.
    Next, <a href='https://www.psychopy.org/download.html#conda'>install Psychopy as an Anaconda environment.</a> You'll
    want to download the .yml file provided by Psychopy. A copy of this file is included in this repository at
    Bassoon/help/psychopy (no guarantees this is up to date).
    While it's not absolutely critical, it's also a good idea to have an IDE from which to launch, edit, and add to
    Bassoon. My preferred IDE is <a href='https://www.spyder-ide.org/'>Spyder,</a> but you can choose any. If you do
    choose Spyder, it is easy to install into your newly built Psychopy environment: launch the Anaconda Navigator app
    and select "environments" from the panel on the lefthand side. If you've successfully installed Psychopy as an
    Anaconda environment you should see it listed here. Click on it to load the environment. Next, find the panel for
    Spyder in the list of applications and click "install."

    <h3>Running Bassoon Using Anaconda</h3>
    To run Bassoon, first download it onto your local device. Then launch the Anaconda command line ('anaconda prompt').
    Enter the command 'conda activate psychopy' and then 'CD' to Bassoon/src in your file directory. Enter the command
    'python main.py' to run Bassoon from the command line. Alternatively, you can view the Bassoon source files by
    entering the command 'spyder'. You can edit and/or run Bassoon from within Spyder (or your preferred IDE). The
    Bassoon GUI is launched by running the main.py file.

    <h2>Using the GUI</h2>
    To launch the Bassoon GUI, locate and run the main.py file inside Bassoon/src. A welcome message should appear in
    the python console and the GUI should launch.

    <h3>Creating an Experiment</h3>
    To create an experiment select an item from the dropdown menu under the 'Available Stimuli' header. Press the 'Add
    Stimulus' button to load this stimulus into the experiment. The list box shows all the stimuli in the current
    experiment in the order that they will be played. Use the Protocol Index button to add a stimulus to a desired index
    in the list box. You can access indexes of stimuli that are already in the list box by clicking on their name and
    then pressing the right mouse button.

    <h3>Edit Stimuli</h3>
    Edit the properties of the stimuli in your experiment by double-clicking on them in the list box or by selecting
    them once and pressing the "Edit" button at the bottom of the main window. A second window should open in which
    editable properties of the stimulus are listed. The first column specifies the property name, the second column
    allows user input to change the property value, and the third column specifies the data type of the property. If the
    property is a list the data type will be listed first as list and then as the data type of each list element (e.g.
    list of strings). List values should be entered using comma-deliniation inside square brackets (e.g. [a, b, c]).
    When you are satisfied with the stimulus properties press 'Apply Changes'. If you've changed a property that affects
    the total length of the stimulus, this change will be reflected in the estimated time for both the stimulus and the
    entire experiment. If Bassoon is unable to update a certain property a message will be displayed in the console to
    reflect the issue. When you're satisfied with the changes you've made to a stimulus, press 'Close Window'.
    <br />
    For programmers, private properties that start with '_' will not appear as editable fields in the second window.

    <h3>Quick Actions</h3>
    The Quick Actions menu can be accessed using the ribbon at the top of the main window. Clicking on this button
    should open the Quick Actions window, which allows you to execute a hodgepodge of commands for the streamlined
    organization of your experiment. Current options include flipping the COMS value (if in use), moving stimuli between
    indices, and copying current stimuli to a desired index.

    <h3>Edit Experiments</h3>
    Like each stimulus, the experiment as a whole also has properties that can be adjusted by the user. To view the
    editable experiment properties open the 'Options' menu at the top of the main window. A second window displaying the
    experiment properties should open. In the 'Stimulus Monitor' section select the monitor calibration that you would
    like to use for the experiment. Monitor calibrations are pulled from monitors that have been added to the monitor
    center on your local copy of Psychopy. You must use the Psychopy GUI (installed with Psychopy) or the Psychopy API
    to add, remove, or edit monitors. <a href='https://www.psychopy.org/api/monitors.html'>See here for more
        information</a>. Select whether you'd like the stimulus to fill the full screen, and choose the screen number (0
    indexed and based on your local machine's display mapping) that you'd like to use. (Note, if your machine has an
    intel integrated graphics card it may not be possible to display psychopy windows on any screen but the primary).
    The information screen section allows you to choose whether you would like a second window to open during the
    experiment that provides information about the progress of the experiment. The monitor and screen options are
    analogous to those for the stimulus screen. The experiment options at the bottom of the window allow you to modify
    basic features of the stimulus. Here are explanations for just a few of them:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Manually Initiate Each Protocol:</b> If selected, the user must manually start each stimulus in the
            experiment via a key press. Protocols also have a manual initiation property. Changing this check box in the
            experiment options window will accordingly modify any stimulus you subsequently add to the experiment in the
            main window, but will not change the properties of previously loaded stimuli. To update these, edit their
            properties directly.</li>
        <li><b>Angle Offset:</b> Allows you to enter an angle (in degrees) that all stimuli will be rotated by. This is
            helpful if there is a known angular discrepency between the display and viewer, as commonly occurs with
            projector based systems.</li>
        <li><b>Write TTL Pulses:</b> Outputs TTL pulses at the start and stop of each epoch when selected (note: TTL
            timing may vary on a stimulus by stimulus basis. E.g. Checkerboard Receptive Field sends a TTL pulse with
            each frame flip. See the specific protocol file for details). Choose the serial port to use in the
            subsequent dropdown window.</li>
        <li><b>TTL Port:</b> Select the serial port name to use during the experiment. If none are available the only
            dropdown option will read 'No Available Ports'. Uses python Serial library to identify serial ports. Will
            not impact the experiment if the "Write TTL Pulses" option is not checked.</li>
        <li><b>Use FBO:</b> Toggle the checkbox to use a frame buffer object or not. If using, select the appropriate
            morph file using the browse button. This feature is necessary when stimuli need to be morphed (e.g.
            spherical morphs for dome/planetarium configurations).</li>
        <li><b>Recompile When Saving:</b> When checked, saving the current experiment will cause each stimulus to be
            reloaded, effectively removing any properties that are changed or created when a stimulus is run. All
            changes that are made to the stimulus by the user in the current session (i.e. via the edit button or by
            double clicking on the stimulus name) will be kept. This setting is automatically turned off when an
            experiment is run such that saving after the experiment is run will not delete recently created properties.
            It is advised to turn this setting on only when you are saving an experiment sketch, but not data from an
            experiment that has been run. If you aren't sure how to handle this setting, it is safest to turn it off.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Once you have made all necessary changes to the experiment, press either the 'Apply Changes' button to use these
    settings in the current experiment, or the 'Save & Apply Changes' button to use these settings in the current and
    all future experiments. Then press 'Close Window' when ready.

    <h3>Saving</h3>
    Once you have loaded all the desired protocols into the experiment and have modified both the protocol and
    experiment settings, you may want to save your experiment before running it. Use the 'Save' button at the bottom of
    the main window. Save the experiment in the desired location. Saving writes two files: a .experiment file and a
    .json file. The .experiment file is a pickled python file that can be reopened in python at any time. It contains
    all the data about your current experiment and can also be used to reload the experiment (using the 'Load
    Experiment' menu option) in case you ever want to run the same experiment again in Bassoon. The .json file writes
    the same data in JSON format and can be used to analyze the experiment outside of python (e.g. in MATLAB). The
    experiment and JSON files contain nearly identical data, however there are cases in which the JSON file may not
    include python specific data types (e.g. numpy arrays). Once you have saved the experiment the 'Save' button should
    appear green in the main window and will remain so until a change is made to the experiment.

    <h3>Running Experiments</h3>
    When you're ready to run your experiment, press the 'Run' button in the main window. The experiment should begin
    playing. If the user initation feature is turned on, you will have to manually start each stimulus by pressing any
    keyboard button (make sure a psychopy window is in focus). Look at the information screen (if available) and console
    for updates about the experiment. To pause in the middle of a stimulus, press the 'p' key while a psychopy window is
    in focus. Any subsequent key press made with a psychopy window in focus will unpause the stimulus. To quit a
    stimulus early, press the 'q' key while a psychopy window is in focus. Pressing q may only exit the current
    iteration of the current stimulus, so you may have to press it a number of times to fully exit the experiment.

    <br>Once the experiment is done playing a save window will appear. Select where you would like to save the
    experiment data. As before, saving will produce both .experiment and .json files. This time, however, there will be
    more data included in the files as many properties are created (and changed) during the experiment 'run time'.
    Pressing cancel in the save window is not advised, however you will still have a chance to save the full experiment
    by pressing save in the main window of the GUI (which should load again once done saving). Make sure the 'recompile
    when saving' option is deselected in the options menu before doing so in order to keep all data from the experiment.

    <h3>Exiting</h3>
    To exit Bassoon press the 'quit' option in the menu bar on the main window, or simply close the main window.

    <h2>Building Experiments Programmatically</h2>
    There are two primary classes in Bassoon: experiments and protocols. To show stimuli, you must first instantiate an
    experiment (make sure you're working directory is set to Bassoon/src):
    <br><code>from experiments.experiment import experiment </code>
    <br><code>e = experiment()</code>
    <br><br>
    Protocols contain stimuli. Each stimulus is a subclass of the protocol superclass. To load a stimulus, say a flash,
    use:
    <br><code>from protocols.Flash import Flash</code>
    <br><code>f = Flash()</code>
    <br><br>
    You can change the properties of a stimulus by directly assigning its attributes:
    <br><code>f.stimTime = 2</code>
    <br><br>
    Load the stimulus into the experiment when you're done setting its attributes. Stimuli will be played in the order
    that they are added to the experiment:
    <br><code>e.addProtocol(f)</code>
    <br><br>
    Experiment attributes can be similarly adjusted:
    <br><code>e.useInformationMonitor = True</code>
    <br><br>
    When you're ready, run the experiment:
    <br><code>e.activate()</code>
